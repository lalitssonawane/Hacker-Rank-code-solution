#Given an array of  distinct integers, transform the array into a zig zag sequence by permuting the array elements. A sequence will be called a zig zag sequence if the first  elements in the sequence are in increasing order and the last  elements are in decreasing order, where . You need to find the lexicographically smallest zig zag sequence of the given array.

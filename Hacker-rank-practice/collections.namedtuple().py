#collections.namedtuple()
#Basically, namedtuples are easy to create, lightweight object types.
#They turn tuples into convenient containers for simple tasks.
#With namedtuples, you donâ€™t have to use integer indices for accessing members of a tuple.


# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
